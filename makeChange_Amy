# Write code to make change for a purchase.
# 
# Your code should accept two parameters: the amount of money offered in cents, and the cost of the item in cents. So you should be able to do make_change(100, 66) to calculate the change required if someone buys something that costs 66 cents using a dollar bill.
# 
# Your code should not simply return the total change: it should return the coins required! So make_change(100, 66) should not just return 34! It should return a quarter, a dime and four pennies!

        myDimes, remaining = divmod(remaining, 10)
        myNickles, remaining = divmod(remaining, 5)
